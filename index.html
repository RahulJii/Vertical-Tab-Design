                        Change is a tenant of software engineering. Our industry constantly changes to meet the needs of
                        innovation and requirements of our customers; further, we have a difficult responsibility to
                        keep up with these trends. Since anyone can create a new blog and begin writing content, an
                        information diet helps us decide where to start.
